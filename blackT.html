                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Black tea leaves or tea bags</li>
                <li>Optional: Sweeteners (sugar, honey), milk, lemon (for flavor)</li>

            <h2>Preparation :</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Boil Water :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by boiling fresh, cold water. The quality of the water can influence the taste of the tea, so use filtered or spring water if possible..</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Preheat Teapot or Teacup :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour a small amount of hot water into the teapot or teacup to warm it. Swirl the water around, then discard it. This step ensures that your teapot or cup is preheated, which helps maintain the tea's temperature.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Add Tea Leaves or Tea Bag :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For loose-leaf tea: Use about one teaspoon of black tea leaves per 8 ounces of water. Place the leaves into a tea infuser or directly into the teapot.</li>
                        <li>For tea bags: Use one tea bag per 8 ounces of water. Place the tea bag into the teapot or teacup.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Pour Hot Water Over the Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the water reaches a rolling boil, pour it over the tea leaves or tea bag. Make sure to cover all the leaves or immerse the tea bag completely.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Steep the Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let the tea steep for 3 to 5 minutes. The steeping time can be adjusted based on your preference for a stronger or milder flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Remove Tea Leaves or Tea Bag :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After steeping, remove the tea leaves or tea bag to prevent over-brewing, which can result in a bitter taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Optional Additions :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Customize your tea by adding sweeteners such as sugar or honey. You can also add milk or a squeeze of lemon for additional flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Stir and Enjoy :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stir your tea gently to mix in any added ingredients. Allow it to cool slightly before sipping. Enjoy your freshly brewed cup of black tea!</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>Remember that the recommended water temperature and steeping time may vary depending on the specific type of black tea you're using, so it's a good idea to check the instructions provided by the tea manufacturer.
