            <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh, cold water</li>
                <li>Yellow tea leaves (specifically processed yellow tea leaves)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Preparation :</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Boil Fresh Water :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin by boiling fresh, cold water. The quality of the water can affect the taste of the tea, so consider using filtered or spring water.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Preheat Teapot or Teacup :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour a small amount of hot water into the teapot or teacup to warm it. Swirl the water around, then discard it. This helps maintain the temperature of the tea during brewing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Measure Yellow Tea Leaves :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use about one to two teaspoons of yellow tea leaves per 8 ounces of water. Place the yellow tea leaves into a tea infuser or directly into the teapot.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Pour Hot Water Over the Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the water has reached a temperature between 160째F to 185째F (71째C to 85째C), pour it over the yellow tea leaves. Avoid using boiling water, as it can affect the delicate flavors of yellow tea</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Steep the Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow the yellow tea to steep for 3 to 5 minutes. The steeping time can be adjusted based on your preference for a stronger or milder flavor. Yellow tea generally requires a slightly longer steeping time compared to green tea.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Strain or Remove Tea Leaves :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After steeping, remove the yellow tea leaves or tea bag to prevent over-brewing. Yellow tea leaves are typically more oxidized than green tea leaves but less than black tea leaves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Optional Additions :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Yellow tea is often enjoyed on its own due to its delicate and nuanced flavors. However, you can add honey or a slice of lemon if desired. Milk is generally not added to yellow tea.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Stir and Enjoy :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stir the tea gently to mix in any added ingredients. Allow the yellow tea to cool slightly before sipping to fully appreciate its subtle and complex flavors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
