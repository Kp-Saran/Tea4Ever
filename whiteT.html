            <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh, cold water</li>
                <li>White tea leaves or white tea bags</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Preparation :</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Boil Fresh Water :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by boiling fresh, cold water. The quality of the water can affect the taste of the tea, so it's recommended to use filtered or spring water.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Preheat Teapot or Teacup :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour a small amount of hot water into the teapot or teacup to warm it. Swirl the water around, then discard it. This helps maintain the temperature of the tea.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Measure White Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use about one to two teaspoons of white tea leaves per 8 ounces of water. Place the tea leaves into a tea infuser or directly into the teapot.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Pour Hot Water Ove the Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the water reaches a temperature between 160째F to 185째F (71째C to 85째C), pour it over the white tea leaves. Be mindful not to use boiling water, as it can scald the delicate leaves and result in a bitter taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Steep the Tea :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow the white tea to steep for 4 to 5 minutes. This steeping time can be adjusted based on your preference for a stronger or milder flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Strain or Remove Tea Leaves :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After steeping, remove the tea leaves or tea bag to prevent over-brewing. White tea leaves can be delicate, so it's essential not to let them steep for too long.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Optional Additions :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            White tea has a delicate flavor, and many people enjoy it without any additions. However, you can add honey or a slice of lemon if desired. Milk is generally not added to white tea, as it may overpower the subtle flavors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Stir and Enjoy :</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stir the tea gently to mix in any added ingredients. Allow it to cool slightly before sipping to fully appreciate the delicate and nuanced flavors of white tea.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
